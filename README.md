# Tools Collection

Collection of random tools and utilities that I coded.

## Utilities
- GJK: Algorithm to detect intersection of shapes.
- cp_progress.py: Copy files with progress bar.
- file_comparer.py: Check if content from two files is the same while handling empty lines and floating point numbers.
- touch.sh: Shell script to update time-stamps for all files in given directory and below.
